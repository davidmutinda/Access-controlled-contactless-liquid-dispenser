## ABSTRACT ##
The access-controlled contactless liquid dispenser prevents the spread of covid-19 by providing a system that dispenses liquids e.g. beverages, without contact. This dispenser only dispenses the beverages to bona fide members. Anyone that doesnâ€™t possess valid identification is be denied access to the beverages in the dispenser. This dispenser also reduces wastage by providing a system that dispenses a specified amount to users and also limits the number of times the users can dispense in a day. The amount dispensed and the number of times a user can use it in a day depends on the user's membership i.e. regular or premium. This dispenser can be employed in school cafeterias to ensure that every student is served with the beverages.
